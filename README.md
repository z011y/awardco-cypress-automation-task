# Awardco Technical Assessment - Cypress Automation Task

#### _You must have npm installed to run this code_

Clone and run

`npx cypress open`

You can find the tests in `/cypress/integration/sales_contact_form.spec.js`

### Purpose

These tests check the form validation requirements and general function of the Work Email field within the Sales Contact form.

I chose to test the Work Email field for the following reasons:

- The Sales Contact form is the most critical function of the website, as it is how Awardco will gain new clients and increase profit.
- Sales will have a difficult time communicating to a potential client without a correct email address.
- The Work Email field has the most complex form validation requirements.

P.S. I was careful not to submit any forms! üëçÔ∏è
